## Project Motivation
My primary motivations for studying the Airbnb Boston dataset are given below,
- _What areas of Boston have the most and the least number of listings_ ?
- _What areas of Boston are the costliest areas to stay_ ?
- _What sets apart a super host from a normal host_ ?
- _How the number of booked listing varies in the time of the year_ ?
